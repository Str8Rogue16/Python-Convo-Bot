# Python-Convo-Bot
MLH Global Hackweek INIT project

Created a quick conversation bot for MLH Challenge to create something in Python. 
I created the original code and then addressed the syntax issues on lines 20 and 32 to get it to work correctly. 

This is one of the first projects I have done in Python. 

I intend to expand upon this over time and make it more indepth.
